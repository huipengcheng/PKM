# Andy Matuschak Mode Obsidian Plugin
Sliding Panes (Andy Matuschak Mode) as a plugin.

This project uses Typescript to provide type checking and documentation.
The repo contains the latest plugin API (obsidian.d.ts) in Typescript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does.

**Note:** The Obsidian API is still in early alpha and is subject to change at any time!

#### Compatibility

Custom plugins are only available for Obsidian v0.9.7+.

The current API of this repo targets Obsidian **v0.9.7**. 

#### How to use

- Clone this repo.
- `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.

#### How to install the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `vault/.obsidian/plugins/plugin-id/`.

## New Features (vs the CSS-only version)
- Note headers stack up on the right _as well as_ the left.
- Changing an active pane scrolls that pane into view.
- Togglable without having to copy CSS into your theme.

## Settings
There is a setting to enable or disable the sliding panes effect, which is also
registered as a command, so you can toggle it from the command pallette or
assign a hotkey.

There are also two settings for heading width (the width of the rotated header) and the leaf width (the width of a single markdown page).

## Notes
This is all very expermental at the moment, so parts might not work, etc.  
It still gets a bit slow if you're loading a lot of documents, so try not to load too many at once.
