# [[Add Chinese Input Method in Linux]]

---

I follow this [instruction](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fcitx5_(%E7%AE%80%E4%BD%93%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87)#%E5%BC%80%E6%9C%BA%E5%90%AF%E5%8A%A8) to install `fcitx5-im` and `fcitx5-chinese-addons`. Then set some environmental variables to `/etc/environment` and make `fcitx5` auto start in [[Awesome WM]].

Then, I install some themes, which stored in `~/.local/share/fcitx5/themes`, and can enable a theme through the config GUI or config file.
