# [[Awesome WM Setup]]

---

## Some Apps Are Not Tiled
In this section, "some apps" is FireFox specifically.

This is peculiar that FireFox is not tiled in the space enabled tile mode while all other apps works great.

After some search, I find it is because FireFox is maxmized in other window environment and FireFox remembers its size regardless of the change of the window environment, thus FireFox may break the tile mode rule.

The solution is logging out and logging into GNOME or KDE to make FireFox not be maxmized and come back to Awesome WM again.
