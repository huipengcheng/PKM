# [[Linux Theme Customization]]

---

## [[GTK]]
I use `LXAppearance` to config theme both for GTK2 and GTK3 applications.

But `LXAppearance` can only change the theme of GTK applications, but can not customize the color scheme unless use LXSession as the session manager.

The GTK2 config file is loacated at `~/.gtkrc-2.0` and the GTK3 config file is located at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-3.0/setting.ini`.

## [[Qt]]

I use `qt5ct` to config theme for Qt5. The important part is adding `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct` to `/etc/environment`. This makes the Qt theme redirect to `qt5ct`.

## Uniform look for Qt and GTK applications
- Choose the same theme that both Qt and GTK have
	- Breeze
	- Adwaita
- Theme engines, which translate themes between one or more toolkits.
	- Kvantum
		- Kvantum provides some themes which are in GTK, such as Arc
		- Set Qt theme to kvantum in qt5ct, and modify theme in kvantummanager.
	- QGtkStyle (located into qt5-styleplugins)

I found that set theme to gtk2 in `qt5ct` also can make Qt application's theme uniform with GTK applications'.
