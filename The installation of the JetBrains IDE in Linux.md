# [[The installation of the JetBrains IDE in Linux]]

---

Presume that I want to install IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate in Arch-based distro, I will download both  `intellij-idea-ultimate-edition` and `intellij-idea-ultimate-edition-jre` packages from AUR. Then if your monitor enables [[HiDPI]], remember to follow [[Applications in 30 bit depth|this guide]] to make it compatible with your 30-bit depth monitor.
