# [[Tracked Things in My Arch]]

---

### Obsidian
Installed by a `AppImage`.

### FSearch
Just like *Everything* in Windows.

### Rofi
A window switcher, application launcher, ssh dialog, dmenu replacement and more.

### xbindkeys
A tool to set keybindings.
I install `xbindkeys_config-gtk2`, a GUI tool for xbindkeys, using pacman.

### GoldenDict++
GoldenDict is a very famous dictionary app, but it is not support OCR. [GoldenDict++](https://autoptr.top/gdocr/GoldenDict-OCR-Deployment/) is a GoldenDict with an additional OCR functionality.

The built-in screen grabber in GoldenDict can not be properly used in Arch, so I install gscreenshot, which is introduced in [[#Screenshot]], and use gscreenshot to grab my screen.

The dictionary file is placed at `~/dict`.

### Flatpak
I only use flatpak to install Bottles to play [[#Fall Guys]].

### Pacwall
Build a wallpaper of the link graph of the installed pacman packages.
